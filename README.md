# Copilot Breakout Session 2

Use the C++ files in the repo for the exercises. Complete the exercises in the sequential order.

## Exercise 1
1. Understand the logic for the exercise1.cpp and add sufficient inline documentation using GitHub Copilot. Create a README markdown file for the program.
2. Add an additional feature to the existing solution using GitHub Copilot prompt crafting techniques and create a unit test plan for the new features. 

## Exercise 2
1. Understand the COBOL file in exercise2.cbl and identify the underlying logic of the program. Translate the codebase in exercise2.cbl to C#, generate unit test cases for the code and corresponding documentation (including README markdown file).

### Exercise 3

1. Translate the codebase you have created to C#, generate unit test cases for the code and corresponding documentation
2. Create a new C++ workspace, which will call an API from US National Weather Service to get the current temperature for a specific zipcode or city. The code should evaluate the temperate and identify the corresponding climate for that region.
