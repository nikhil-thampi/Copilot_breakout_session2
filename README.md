# Copilot Breakout Session 2

Use the C++ files in the repo for the exercises. Complete the exercises in the sequential order.

## Exercise 1
1. Understand the logic for the exercise1.cpp and add sufficient inline documentation using GitHub Copilot. Create a README markdown file for the program.
2. Add an additional feature to the existing solution using GitHub Copilot prompt crafting techniques and create a unit test plan for the new features. 

## Exercise 2
1. Understand the COBOL file in exercise2.cbl and identify the underlying logic of the program. Translate the codebase in exercise2.cbl to C#, generate unit test cases for the code and corresponding documentation (including README markdown file).

### Exercise 3

1. Understand the existing logic in exercise3.cs and verify whether there are any existing issues/vulnerabilities. 
2. Add an additional feature to the existing solution using GitHub Copilot prompt crafting techniques
3. Create unit test cases for the updated code and generate the documentation to the program in such a way that a person who is compartively new to C# should be able to understand the logic.
